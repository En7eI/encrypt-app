# encrypt-app
Simple web application that generates and uses an elliptic key pair to sign messages.

# Description
Run the server using the following command:

```
node server.js
```
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. 
You should see a text input field to enter a message and a "Sign" button. 
When you submit a message, the server will sign it using the generated private key and return the signature, which will be displayed on the page.

# Summary 
This setup provides a basic implementation of a web app that generates an elliptic key pair, signs messages, and displays the signatures.
